How does the Internet work?

The workings of the internet are a culmination of many moving parts. According to many the internet is just a screen display with objects (words, images, etc.), that can be accessed by using a web address (Uniform Resource Locator (URL)). The foundation of the internet is the communication of client- server technologies by the process of sending/receiving requests and responses. The client-side of this communication is based on the development of web/front-end applications using both Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) at the core. In addition to the communication between HTML and CSS, JavaScript is an interactive technology that is essential to the demonstration and behavior of web/front-end applications. The server-side of the communication consists of application and database servers that store and provide data responses based on the back-end applications/technologies. All of the communications for both front-end and back-end interactions are handled by networks and security protocols that dictate that path and direction of requests and responses. 

When happens when you click on a link?

When a link is clicked an event/action is performed based on coded instructions. Considering that the link is active and has been developed to trigger communication to either or both the front-end and back-end environments. This communication will result in an event/action that will require a request and/or a response.
